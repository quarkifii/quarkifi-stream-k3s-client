[](https://github.com/quarkifii/quarkifi-stream-k3s-client.git)

This repository provides the K3S thin client required to use [Quarkifi Stream](https://qstream.quarkifi.com/) Edge Computing Management.

## What Is Edge Computing and Quarkifi Stream Platform
Edge computing is a distributed model that processes data near its source—often on devices like Raspberry Pi or Banana Pi—to minimize latency and bandwidth consumption. Using a platform like [Quarkifi Stream](https://qstream.quarkifi.com/), users can define device endpoints in the cloud and manage applications as containers within a lightweight K3s runtime on the edge devices. This allows for full lifecycle management, including deployment, starting, stopping, and scaling applications remotely.

**Benefits:**

-   **Reduced Latency:** Enables real-time processing for applications like autonomous driving.
    
-   **Improved Security:** Minimizes data exposure by limiting transmission across networks.
    
-   **Lower Operational Costs:** Decreases reliance on expensive cloud bandwidth and infrastructure.
